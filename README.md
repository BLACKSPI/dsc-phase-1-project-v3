Analysis of Aviation Data
In order to assist a business in determining which aircraft pose the least risk for their commercial and private activities, this initiative focuses on evaluating aviation accident data. The main goal is to offer practical insights based on past accident patterns, severity ratings, and aircraft attributes. The corporation will be able to lower operational risks and make wise judgments when buying airplanes thanks to these information.

Procedure for Cleaning Data
Data Collection: The Aviation Accident Database dataset, which is accessible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), was obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

Data Cleaning:
To guarantee the precision and dependability of the study, missing values were found and dealt with suitably.
Where required, further data transformations were used to improve consistency.

Important Results:
Models of High-Risk Aircraft:
The highest accident rates have been linked to aircraft models like the Cessna, Piper, and Beech.
This analysis offers useful information for enhancing safety protocols, directing procurement choices, and lowering the company's total operational risks.

Data Source:
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) provided the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses).


Tools for Visualization:

Tableau: A tool for building interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data insights.
Libraries for Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used for data manipulation and visualization during the analysis process.
Code and Analysis: The Jupyter Notebook contains documentation and reproducible steps for the analysis.
